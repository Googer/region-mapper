# region-mapper
Pokemon Go Pittsburgh region mapper for gyms

This simple utility uses an output gyms.json file from [GymScraper](https://github.com/Googer/GymScraper) and a Google Maps KML file for associated regions into which you want to map said gyms.

The output is a json file that maps from the region names to the gym id's within them for use in an instance of the [PgP discord bot](https://github.com/ForcedUnknown/discord-bot).
